[mod-setting-description]
mqs-locomotive-changes=Acceleration, braking power and speed
mqs-speed-magnitude=Rocket fuel gives 15% + 4.5% per quality. At "Balanced", each locomotive quality level also gives a bonus of 4.5% (multiplicative with fuel effects). At "Significant", a legendary locomotive running on coal is as fast as a normal locomotive running on legendary rocket fuel. Higher multipliers are only present 
mqs-speed-magnitude-old=Rocket fuel gives 15% + 4.5% per quality. At "Balanced", a legendary locomotive with normal rocket fuel matches a normal locomotive with legendary rocket fuel. At "Significant", a legendary locomotive with coal reaches the same speed.
mqs-wagon-changes=When speed scaling is set to "0" or locomotive changes are disabled, "Minimal" makes no changes to wagons.
mqs-rocket-changes=Scale rocket launch speed with quality (similar to QualityRockets)
mqs-roboport-changes=Scale charging pad count with quality
mqs-robot-changes=Scale robot speed and/or cargo capacity. Currently requires manually placing the bots in the world, and lacks any way of converting them back into their vanilla item form.
mqs-mining-drill-changes=Scale mining drill speed and/or area
mqs-change-all=Also apply quality changes to entities added by other mods. Might cause compatibility issues - please report those on the mod page.
